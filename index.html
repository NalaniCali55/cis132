    <p>I am a mother to 4 beautiful children ages 24, 17, 15, and 11 years old. I work full time for a popular footwear company as a Logistics Coordinator. I decided to return to school and obtain my associates degree in business and eventually receive a bachelors degree as well. My ultimate goal is to start a business of my own that I can pass down to my children.</p>
    
<h2>When I have free time</h2>  
    <ol>
        <li>I like doing outdoor activities with my children.</li>
        <li>I enjoy going to the shooting range with my husband.</li>
        <li>I like to read non-fictional books.</li>
    </ol>   
    
<p>My favorite web site is <a href="http://www.melaleuca.com/">Melaleuca</a> because it is my favorite place to shop for all our household goods.</p>
